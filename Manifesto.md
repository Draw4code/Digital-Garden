This manifesto will serve to bridge the gap between who I am and who I want to become and a reminder to avoid person hypocrisy by always aligning my internal beliefs with my external actions. 

I no longer define myself with religion, but with a mix spiritual & philosophical practices that help to guide my understanding of the world and it is ever evolving, unpredictable and beautiful. 

I believe there is a being higher than man (I call him/her God), known by many names. This higher being grant us the authority to manifest......by simply speaking things into existence. 


### Foundational 
(1. **Foundational Beliefs:** Start by identifying what you know to be true. This might include your worldview or a critique of the "status quo" you are rejecting.)

### Core Values
(1. **Core Values:** List the non-negotiable principles that guide your decisions. Narrow this down to 3–5 essential values (e.g., integrity, curiosity, courage) to keep your focus sharp.)

### Future Vision
(1. **Future Vision:** Describe the ideal version of yourself and the world you want to live in. Write this in the **present tense** as if it is already happening (e.g., "I lead with compassion" rather than "I will lead with compassion").)

### Action Plan 
(1. **Action Plan (The Rules):** Convert your values into specific "rules for living". Instead of saying "I value health," write "I treat my body as my most valuable asset".)

### Declaration
(**Closing Declaration:** A bold summary of your commitment to these principles, often acting as a final "call to action" for yourself.)




If I cannot add goodness with my words, I will add strength with my silence. 
I will not curse what I cannot control, I will shape what I can with calm words, kindness and understanding. 
My belief is my seed, my speech is my water, my actions are the fruit.
