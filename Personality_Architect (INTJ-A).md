## Architect (INTJ-A)
[Introverted](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-introverted-vs-extraverted) - 82% (Energy)
**Strength in Reserve**
Introverts are well-suited to many situations. A tendency to be reserved helps these personality types to pace themselves. They’re likely to listen to others more carefully. Very introspective, Introverts enjoy more focused “alone time” – leading to more and deeper insights. And, while sometimes too sensitive to their environments, this often helps them pick up cues more quickly, making them great at reading many situations.
[Intuitive](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-intuitive-vs-observant) - 63% (Mind)
**Eyes on the Horizon**
People with the Intuitive trait prefer to exercise their imaginations as they seek new ideas and possibilities. They live their day-to-day lives just like any other personality type. But while that’s happening, their minds tend to point inward while at the same time gently focusing somewhere beyond the horizon. Their lives are ones of questioning, wondering, and connecting the dots in the “bigger picture,” and they love the theoretical. They often ask, “What if?” and ponder the possibilities the future might hold.
[Thinking](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling) - 66% (Nature) 
**“How Does This Help?”**
>People with the Thinking personality trait can use rational thought to see that humans are inherently emotional – and that this is okay. When presented with a decision, people with the Thinking trait typically lean on objective information. Knowledge is their indispensable tool. Once these personality types gather the facts, they test their alternatives against logic and reason to see which decision, by those standards, proves the most effective or realistic. They generally manage their relationships by employing fairness and effectiveness as their primary method of dealing with others. Their passions are born of respect.Personality types with the Thinking trait are likely to evaluate things almost relentlessly. This isn’t as bad as it sounds. They aren’t satisfied if they believe something is not well thought out – they revel in the brilliance of an elegant plan. This makes them great to have around when critical thinking and impartiality of any kind is the focus, and this makes them immensely helpful for sorting out ideas and methods. Their primary filter is, “_How_ does this help?”

[Judging](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting) - 89%- (Tactics) - **Making Things as They Ought to Be**
People with the Judging (J) personality trait feel most comfortable when the course ahead is well-marked. They would rather come up with five backup plans than deal with events as they come. Preferring to consider their options ahead of time, personality types with this trait prefer clarity and closure, sticking with the plan rather than going with the flow. It’s as if Judging types always keep a mental checklist. When they cross something off their list – or even start an item on their list – they consider it complete and not open to reconsideration.
The downside is, if they take this too far, those with the Judging trait sometimes come across as rigid. However, most are not unreasonably stubborn. It’s important to remember their need for structure always is a preference and reality often calls on them to respond in unforeseen ways. Too many surprises in a row can leave these personality types frustrated and stressed. When this happens, they can still be relied on to develop a plan (and a contingency plan), but however well they handle the unexpected, they rarely enjoy it.

Judging individuals tend to have a strong work ethic, putting their duties and responsibilities above everything else. To them, rules, laws, and standards are the key to success. They can be too dependent on these measures, whether applied to themselves or others. But the intent is almost always one of fairness and results.

[Assertive](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/assertive-architect-intj-a-vs-turbulent-architect-intj-t) - 69% (Identity)
**Calm in the Storm**
Assertive individuals are self-assured, even-tempered, and resistant to stress. They don’t worry too much, but this is different from apathy. They aim for goals and want successful results, but they typically won’t let nervousness color the path to their accomplishments. They’re unlikely to spend a lot of time thinking about their past actions or choices. According to Assertive personality types, what’s done is done. Assertive personality types learn lessons from their personal histories, but they see little purpose in entertaining the same regrets again and again. However, problems may arise for them if their confidence turns into overconfidence. Assertive individuals may gloss over problems or details that can interfere with their goals and desired results. They may lean toward assuming all will be positive. Assertive people also sometimes presume they are free to do much more than others would allow or tolerate. If overconfident, these personality types may come to believe their confidence overshadows what others want. But their confidence remains. It can help them move forward where others might hesitate. People with this personality trait report more satisfaction with their lives. They feel more assured of their abilities to handle the difficult and the unexpected. Through this lens, they often create the kinds of success that matter to them.

## A Pioneering Spirit

INTJs question most things, basing their beliefs on solid evidence, reasoning, and rationality. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and other people’s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical INTJ personalities prefer to make their own discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren’t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval – in fact, they often rather enjoy it.

But as anyone with this personality type would tell you, a new idea isn’t worth anything unless it actually works. INTJs want to be successful, not just inventive. They bring a single-minded drive to their work, applying the full force of their insight, logic, and willpower. They have little patience for anyone who tries to slow them down by enforcing pointless rules or offering poorly thought-out criticism – though astute observations are generally welcome.

People with the INTJ personality type, independent to the core, want to shake off other people’s expectations and pursue their own ideas.

This personality type comes with a strong independent streak. INTJs don’t mind acting alone – in fact, they prefer their own company most of the time – perhaps in part because they don’t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. People with this personality type often have no problem making decisions without asking for anyone else’s input. At times, this lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration others’ thoughts, desires, and plans.

It would be a mistake, however, to view INTJ personalities as uncaring. Whatever the stereotypes about their stoic intellect, they feel deeply. When things go wrong or when they hurt others, they are personally affected and spend much time and energy trying to figure out why things happened the way that they did. These personalities may not always value emotion as a decision-making tool, and they have a very hard time relating to people who lead with their hearts, but they are still authentically human.

## A Thirst for Knowledge

INTJs can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists. They believe that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging goals. They are firm believers that taking the easy way out in any given situation prevents people from achieving greatness. But these personalities may be cynical about human nature more generally, assuming that most people are lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity.

People with the INTJ personality type derive much of their self-esteem from their knowledge and mental acuity. In school, they may have been called “bookworms” or “nerds.” But rather than taking these labels as insults, many people with this type embrace them. They recognize their own ability to teach themselves about – and master – any topic that interests them, whether that’s coding or capoeira or classical music.

INTJs don’t just learn new things for show – they genuinely enjoy expanding the limits of their knowledge.

In their seemingly constant pursuit of knowledge, people with this personality type can sometimes be single-minded, with little patience for frivolity, distractions, or idle gossip. That said, they’re far from dull or humorless. Many INTJ personalities are known for their irreverent wit, and beneath their serious exteriors, they often have a sharp, delightfully sarcastic sense of humor.

## Social Frustrations

INTJs aren’t known for being warm and fuzzy. They tend to prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries – in other words, they’d rather be right than popular. And because these personalities value truth and depth, many common social practices – from small talk to white lies – may seem pointless or downright stupid to them. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or even offensive when they’re only trying to be honest.

At times, people with the INTJ personality type may wonder whether dealing with other people is even worth the frustration.

But like any personality type, INTJs do crave social interaction – they’d just prefer to surround themselves with people who share their values and priorities. Often, they can achieve this just by being themselves. When they pursue their interests, their authenticity can draw people to them – professionally, socially, and even romantically.

## The Chess Game of Life

People with the INTJ personality type are full of contradictions. They are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused. From the outside, these contradictions may seem baffling, but they make perfect sense once you understand the inner workings of this personality type’s mind.

For these personalities, life is like a giant game of chess. Relying on strategy rather than chance, INTJs contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it. And they never lose faith that, with enough ingenuity and insight, they can find a way to win – no matter what challenges might arise along the way.
